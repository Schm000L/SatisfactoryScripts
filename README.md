Scripts to assist me playing Satisfactory

## factorycalc.py
Small script to calculate what's needed to produce a given set of products
Main script in factorycalc.py
recipes.json contains the various recipes that can be used to produce products, this list is maintained manually by me and new recipes are added as I come across them ingame.
Expect recipes.json to be incomplete, and as new updates of the game rolls out possibly out-of-date too

The result of factorycalc.py puts its result in out.json, an example is provided here in this repository.

Further ideas:
1. Handle alternative recipes, possibly lazy solution by user-provided list
2. Calculate all production routes
3. Implement selection algorithm to find best alternatives from 1.
